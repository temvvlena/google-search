## Google-Search Web Application

**Utilized**: ReactJS, CSS, HTML, Firebase (Backend)

**Deployed on Firebase**: [Click Here](https://search-9dff5.web.app/).

It fetches Google API and works exactly the same as Google.
However, only allowed 100 requests per/day. So, please don't spam. Thank you! :)

**How does it look?**
